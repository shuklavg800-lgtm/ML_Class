# print(name)

# strings are immutable hence we cannot do

# # accessing the name by different indexes
# print(name[0])
# print(name[1])
# print(name[2])
# print(name[3])
# print(name[4])
# print(name[5])


## the negative  indexing starts from last and it start from -1 not from 0
# print(name[-1])


# example of slicing in python
# print (name[2:5])
print(name[-1:-1])
